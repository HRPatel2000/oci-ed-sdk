# oci-ed-sdk

## Goal

Create, Update, Delete and Get/List Opens Tracking via Java SDK

## Prerequisites

- OCI Cloud Account
  - Setup Email Delivery Service Resources,
    - Create Email Domain
    - Create Approved Sender
    - Enable Relay Logs on your Email Domain

- Setup OCI Authentication
  - OCI CLI requires active OCI Cloud account. Please visit OCI Cloud Website to signup if you haven't yet.
  - OCI CLI also requires OCI Cloud Authentication setup on your local workstation. You can follow the CLI Setup Document section Setting up the Config File to do that
  - Config File with tenancy id, user id, fingerprint, key file and region can be also found on your OCI Console under Profile â†’ User Section on the Top Right corner. Image below shows the option "View Configuration file" on the OCI Console to copy a file and save on your workstation as ~/.oci/config file
  - Refer this document to get the OCIDs and Keys from OCI Console - https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five
  - Save the API KEY (private key file) under ~/.oci/
  - Change the path below to point to this private key file in your ~/.oci/config
```shell
key_file=~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem
```
- This completes the Authentication Setup and your OCI CLI is ready to use Http Send API feature


## Setup

Install Required OCI Email Preview SDK Libraries/JARs
- If you are Oracle Internal Team and within Oracle Network, Just take the /lib/settings.xml and either replace it to your ~/.m2/settings.xml or take the internal SNAPSHOT repository from it and put into your ~/.m2/settings.xml
- If you are not Oracle Internal Team, you need to get oci-java-sdk-email-3.7.1-preview1-SNAPSHOT.jar from your Account Manager and then copy it inside /lib directory and then run the commands below

```shell
cd lib/
./ociSDKInstall.sh
```

## Configuration

Instructions
- Clone the project
- Change your OCI config File Path in OpensEmailSDKClient.java (under CONFIG_LOCATION variable) if it is different than default - ".oci/config"
- Change your OCI Profile in OpensEmailSDKClient.java (under CONFIG_PROFILE variable)
- Change your OCI COMPARTMENT_ID and TRACK_CONFIG_SCOPE_ID in OCITenancyConfig.java 

## Build and Test

- Build the Project
```java
mvn clean package
```
- This would run Test cases mentioned below in exact order as mentioned,
  - Create Opens Tracking Configuration
  - Get Tracking Configuration by ID
  - Update Opens Tracking Configuration
  - List Opens Tracking Configurations by Email Domain
  - List Opens Tracking Configurations by Compartment ID
  - Delete Opens Tracking Configuration by ID

## Use OCI Email Opens APIs from OCI Java Function

- Prereqiusite - Working OCI Function with proper permissions and policies
- Deploy this java code to your OCI Function and then invoke it
- You can use the code from this project or just use the project to create the New OCI Function
